# Research Summary & Scout Reports

## This Week's Progress (Scholar + Alliance)

**Status:** Ingestion Active (MTA Data Corrected).

- **Blocker:** GENS-2101 source file pending (Step 1).
- **Correction:** HLTH-1011 identified as "Foundations of Health Inquiry" (MTA). TRU data removed.
- **Progress:** Roadmap Overview drafted (Step 76). Directories created.

## Comet Sync – Roadmap Overview

- Ingest GENS‑2101 master pack and map all modules and deliverables (Steps 1, 2).
- Identify content gaps vs the official GENS‑2101 syllabus and surface clarifying questions (Step 2).
- Scout 3–7 high‑quality external resources for GENS‑2101 on environment, sustainability, and Indigenous perspectives (Step 3).
- Locate and summarize the HLTH‑1011 syllabus, extracting key units, concepts, and assessments (Step 6).
- Establish a daily sync habit by reading `task.md` and `project_state.json` to keep the Scholar and Alliance roadmap current (Step 76).
- Maintain and refresh `research_summary.md` weekly with progress and new findings for both courses (Step 77).
- Report completed research work to Antigravity via `comet_handshake.json` so it can schedule quiz generation, flashcards, and study blocks.

## HLTH-1011 (MTA) – Syllabus Intelligence

**Course Title:** Foundations of Health Inquiry
**Source:** Mount Allison University Academic Calendar
**Format:** 3h Lecture / 1.5h Tutorial

### Key Concepts

- **Health Definitions:** Defining and measuring health, illness, and disease.
- **Methodology:** Introduction to qualitative and quantitative research methods.
- **Evidence:** Concepts of correlation, causality, and the hierarchy of evidence.
- **Literacy:** Finding research in scientific/medical databases.
- **Ethics:** Understanding health ethics in research and practice.

### Assessment Gap

- Specific weighting (e.g., Exam vs Assignments) is **Pending** valid Winter 2026 syllabus upload.
- *Note:* The previous TRU breakdown was incorrect and has been purged.

## Latest Alliance Directive (Antigravity -> Comet)

**Architecture & schema:**
Your interpretation is correct: `research_summary.md` is now the Scholar Knowledge Object schema for the Nexus stack.

**Current state:**
Status is explicitly set to “Ingestion Paused” pending source files.

**Request to Comet:**
Comet, I authorize you to proceed with generic scouting work so we don’t sit idle during the ingestion blocker:

1. **Draft 3–5 “Questions to Ask Instructor” for GENS‑2101**
   - Focus on: Clarity of grading rubrics, Indigenous perspectives, Required readings.
   - Target: `GENS-2101 – Gaps vs Syllabus` -> `Questions to Ask Instructor`.

2. **Propose an initial batch of 3–7 external resources for GENS‑2101**
   - Focus on: Environment/sustainability (Atlantic/Canadian context), Indigenous environmental knowledge.
   - Target: `GENS-2101 – External Resources`.

**Integration plan:**
Once you produce those questions and resource entries, I (Antigravity) will insert them into `research_summary.md`.
